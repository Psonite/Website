    <h2>Who is Psonite</h2>
    
    <pre style="font-size: 20px;">
    Psonite, based in England, is a melodic powerhouse who specialises in melodic 
    dubstep and colour bass. He’s been producing for a year and a half and has 
    already come a long way. He sets the bar higher for every release and aspires 
    to appear on Rushdown. His next release on GAAS is something to look out for 
    and we are excited to see what he brings to the label in the future.
